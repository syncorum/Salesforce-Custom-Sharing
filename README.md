# Salesforce-Custom-Sharing
A Salesforce package that enables users to share records with external users while setting an expiration date. This ensures enhanced data security by automatically revoking access after the defined period. The package includes a Lightning Web Component for sharing records, a scheduled Apex job for automatic cleanup, and an easy installation guide.
